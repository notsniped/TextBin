# TextBin
To throw away copies.
Version R2.1.0 (September 2021 feature update) (09/13/2021)

# About...
TextBin was made in mind that most Operating Systems can only have one piece of data copied at a time.

So, TextBin is a place to throw away copies and store them on your browser safely for a temporary amount of time.
It is not an actual text application, like: 
> Notepad

> Word

> and more.

# Features...
> It's main intended purpose is to store data on RAM. Not to save as a file on your main storage.

> It will not save data on the cloud. Closing the browser will delete all of your data from the previous sessions.

> We are working on localstorage saving of data (COMING SOON).
# End...
